# discordActivityLogger
Watch a invite code to track activity of a server
## Usage
Tested and ran on debian 10.
This is an express server that will connect to a mongodb through **localhost:27017/myproject** once up and running you can connect to the display on port 3000. 
Running npm start will run both the backend and frontend script, by default we log invite hwidspoofer.
